# BPBWholesaleSite
## The Back Porch Bakery Wholesale Page
This site will: 
- gather orders and account information from wholesale customers.
- be the admin portal for in depth administration of orders, logistics, and wholesale account settings.
- Create packing and delivery information for logistics team
- Create production reports for bakery crew.
- be a portal for updating day-to-day bakery inventory information.
- be a portal for wholesale customers to view their billing and pay their bills (using Quickbooks API).

## Initial Wireframe
Dan is building a nonfunctioning wireframe layout of the site at:
- https://danberkeland.github.io/BPBWholesaleSite/WholesaleWireframe/index.html

## GUI Goals
- Desktop graphic interface (BPB Admin)
- Mobile Graphic Interface (simple and intuitive for potentially not so tech saavy kitchen crews.)

  Remember, these users are usually not sitting at a desk but are sweaty, tired, smelling like garlic and probably stirring something while placing their order.  Put yourself in their shoes.

  - Big Buttons
  - Minimum viable amount of information.
  - Clear announcement of order placement.
  - Ideally, customer receives a text confirmation of any changes they make.
