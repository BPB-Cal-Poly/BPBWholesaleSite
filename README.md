# BPBWholesaleSite
## The Back Porch Bakery Wholesale Page
This site will: 
- gather orders and account information from wholesale customers.
- be the admin portal for in depth administration of orders, logistics, and wholesale account settings.
- Create packing and delivery information for logistics team
- Create production reports for bakery crew.
- be a portal for updating day-to-day bakery inventory information.
- be a portal for wholesale customers to view their billing and pay their bills (using Quickbooks API).

## Initial Wireframe
Dan is building a nonfunctioning wireframe layout of the site at:

# Steps


## 1. GUI Goals
- Desktop graphic interface (BPB Admin)
- Mobile Graphic Interface (simple and intuitive for potentially not so tech saavy kitchen crews.)

  Remember, these users are usually not sitting at a desk but are sweaty, tired, smelling like garlic and probably stirring something while placing their order.  Put yourself in their shoes.

  - Big Buttons
  - Minimum viable amount of information.
  - Clear announcement of order placement.
  - Ideally, customer receives a text confirmation of any changes they make.

## 2. The Database
- Develop to database
  - Products
  - Customers
  - Orders
  - Other

## 3. Deploying to the web
- Best way to put this online.  AWS?

## 4. Checks, Balances, Limitations on Ordering
- Proofread orders for mistakes and limitations.
  - lead time limitations
  - quantity limitations
  - delivery limitations

## 5. Customer Alerts & Confirmations
- Develop meaningful automated communication with the customer.

## 6. Logistics Reports
- Design clear reports for our drivers.
  - What needs to go where?
  - Most efficient route?
  - Paper invoices to be delivered with order

## 7. Production Reports
- Design clear reports for our bakers.
  - How much to mix?
  - How much to shape?
  - How much to bake?
  - How much to prep?

## 8. API link to Quickbooks for billing
- Figure out how to work with Quickbooks for handling our customers' billing.
